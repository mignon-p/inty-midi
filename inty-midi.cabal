-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Convert MIDI files to IntyBASIC format.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
    @inty-midi@ is a program which will convert a MIDI file into a
    format playable by IntyBASIC on an Intellivision game
    console.  Specifically, @inty-midi@ generates an IntyBASIC file
    containing @MUSIC@ lines, which can then be included in an IntyBASIC
    program with the @include@ directive.  (Or, when given the @-m@
    command-line option, @inty-midi@ generates a stand-alone IntyBASIC
    file which will play the music when run.)
