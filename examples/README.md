This directory contains some MIDI files and the resulting IntyBASIC
files generated by `inty-midi`.  All of these pieces are in the public
domain.

Because they are generated with the `-m` flag, the output files are
standalone IntyBASIC programs which you can run to play the piece.

## Greensleaves (Traditional)

* Source: <https://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/piece-info.cgi?id=109>
* Command line: `inty-midi -m Greensleaves.mid Greensleaves.bas`

## Canon in D, by Johann Pachelbel

* Source: <https://musescore.com/user/3349846/scores/1376056>
* Command line: `inty-midi -m -q 16 Canon_in_D.mid Canon_in_D.bas`

This MIDI file requires quantization, which is why the `-q 16` option
is specified.

## The Entertainer, by Scott Joplin

* Source: <https://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/piece-info.cgi?id=263>
* Command line: `inty-midi -m The_Entertainer.mid The_Entertainer.bas`

The Entertainer requires the ECS.  Even with the six voices provided
by the ECS, there are a few notes dropped due to too many voices.
Ther are also a few notes dropped due to being outside the range
supported by IntyBASIC.  Personally, I don't notice these dropped
notes, though.
